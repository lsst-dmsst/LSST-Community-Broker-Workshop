% Leanne to Ensure that the community broker workshop paper includes a statement about the number of brokers we can support and the technical implications 

\begin{abstract}
Beginning late 2022, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), will produce a nightly stream of ten million public alerts that will disseminate new information about transient, variable, and moving objects within 60 seconds.  A number of \emph{Community Brokers} will be selected to receive the full LSST alert stream, adding additional scientific value, and providing science users the ability to identify targets of interest and trigger follow-up observations.  In June 2019, the LSST project hosted a workshop on \emph{Community Brokers} in Seattle, WA, USA. The overarching goal of the workshop was to bring together Rubin Observatory Project personnel, representatives of the LSST Science Collaborations, proposers of community brokers and follow-up facilities to develop a vision of an integrated global ecosystem for transient science with the LSST alert stream. Topics of discussion included, scientific use cases and expectations for the LSST Prompt data products, LSST-broker interfaces, architecture and technology choices, the broker selection process, policy issues, and development progress and lessons learnt from precursor surveys. This paper provides a summary of that workshop and a road-map towards a building a global integrated ecosystem for time-domain science in the LSST era.
