% Putting it all together in here - how do we run it all in operations
\section{Alert ecosystem in  LSST  Operations (Leanne)} \label{sec:conops}
One of the key motivators for this workshop was to develop a vision of an integrated global ecosystem for  {transient} science in the  LSST era. Here we describe the concept of operations not just for  LSST alert stream but but the whole system integrated ecosystem for  {transient} science in the  LSST Era.

%%% Recommendations
To address these challenges, we make the following recommendations:

\nrec{teststreams}
{Investigate the possibility of providing test streams for broker testing}
{Investigate the possibility of the project providing test streams of alerts for brokers and downstream  {TOMS} to enable broker development, data challenges, and operations rehearsals
}

\nrec{usercomputing}
{Provide a more robust definition of “10\% of the  LSST computational system”}
{Provide a more robust estimate of what “10\% of the  LSST computational system” means, so that the scientists and future users can begin to figure out whether that will meet their needs, and prepare grants/proposals.
}

\nrec{filteredstreams}
{Investigate the possibility of providing filtered streams}
{Clarify if/how the project could provide filtered streams, e.g
Simple filters:  {RA}/DEC, Magnitude, Spuriousness cuts?
Image-free streams of alert packets?
sources associated with past alerts?
and provide estimate of how much the stream volume is reduced by these options.
}

\nrec{expandedaccessstream}
{Investigate options for expanding access to the alert stream}
{There is clear demand for expanding (near-) real time access to the full alert stream to ~tens of users, and a number of ways to get there:
less information in alerts
accepting longer latencies (5 minutes, not 60 seconds?)
network of mirrors forwarding the stream
cloud hosting}
